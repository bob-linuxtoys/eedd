This folder contains code in the following directories that are specific 
to the DP AVR peripheral (see the Demand Peripherals wiki for more details):

  include
    Contains the following header files that implement communication facilities 
    between the AVR and the dpserver daemon.
    
    dpavr.h
      This header file implements the "host registers" that are the basis
      of dpserver-to-AVR communications.
      
    dpavrusart.h
      This header file provides basic AVR code to use the on-chip USART0 to
      perform communications with an external terminal emulator via the Tx and
      Rx pins.  This "console" functionality provides an excellent way to help
      debug any DP AVR application by allowing messages to be sent.
    
  samples
    Contains the following sample AVR application code that illustrates the usage 
    of the AVR-to-dpserver communitation facilities:
    
    led
      This application is a very basic example of an LED flashing application 
      that can be controlled via the command line with dpserver.  
      
    fifo
      This application implements a basic fifo that connects the command line 
      to the AVR USART0 (using the Tx/Rx signals) which can be seen using an 
      external terminal emulation application.
